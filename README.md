Is Outer Wilds too easy? Is the time loop not stressful enough? Then look no further, for this mod may be the solution!

The Dark Bramble hive mind has recently employed it's newest Time Assassin, Ernesto, to hunt you down. Equipped with a handheld portal gun and his very own phase inducer, letting him pass through solid objects, this anglerfish is going to stop at nothing to find you. Escape is impossible, and it's only a matter of time before you're caught. How long can you survive?

If you find yourself bored of the Outer Wilds solar system, try throwing in some story mods. Ernesto should be able to hunt you in any solar system you travel to.

Some suggestions for challenges:
- Set Ernesto's speed to max
- Beat Permadeath Mode
- Complete story mods
- Beat Outer Relics
- Enable stealth mode (jumpscare warning)

Sadly, this mod does not work in multiplayer. How is Ernesto going to chase two hatchlings at once?
